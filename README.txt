The goal of the game is to place plants in the way of zombies to shoot them (as they move from right to left).
Level 1 only uses the top row and each subsequent level uses an additional row
If a zombie reaches the left side of the screen, you lose
If you beat level 10, you win

CHEAT: Press A & B at the same time on the start screen to enable the cheat. With the cheat enabled, you can upgrade
plants to the top tier without consuming any additional seeds (which allows them to shoot much faster).

Use START to navigate from the splash screen to instructions
Use START to navigate from instructions to game play
While in game:
    Press A to spawn a new plant (assuming you have at least 1 seed available)
        Use arrows to move it around
        Press A again to place it (it won't fire until it's been placed)
        You can tell if it's been placed by artwork
        Press B before placing it to upgrade it (this will consume more seeds)
            There are only 3 levels
            Levels are distinguished by color (for now)
            Higher levels = less shooting cooldown time

While paused:
